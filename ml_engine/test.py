A new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui's team,[6] titled New Crayon Shin-chan (新クレヨンしんちゃん, Shin Kureyon Shin-chan).

An animated television adaptation began airing on TV Asahi in 1992 and is still ongoing, with over 1200 episodes.

Set in the city of Kasukabe of Saitama Prefecture within the Greater Tokyo Area of Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.

Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. """))
